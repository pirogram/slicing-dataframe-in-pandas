    `DataFrame` is the core data structure in Pandas. Usually, for any exploratory data analysis work, we would first load the dataset in a `DataFrame` and then go from there.

    Slicing is an important aspect of working with a `DataFrame`. It lets us select specific sections of the `DataFrame` either horizontally or vertically (or  both).

    In this topic, we'll look at the overall slicing syntax and perform some common slicing operations.

    For illustration purposes, we'll use a dataset that contains information about biographical movies. The data was sourced from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/biopics) and has the following variables:

    Variable | Definition
    ---|---------
    `title` | Title of the film.
    `site` | URL from IMDB.
    `country` | Country of origin.
    `year_released` | Year of release.
    `box_office` | Gross earnings at U.S. box office.
    `director` | Director of film.
    `number_of_subjects` | The number of subjects featured in the film.
    `subject` | The actual name of the featured subject.
    `type_of_subject` | The occupation of subject or reason for recognition.
    `race_known` | Indicates whether the subjectâ€™s race was discernible based on background of self, parent, or grandparent.
    `subject_race` | Race of the subject.
    `person_of_color` | Dummy variable that indicates person of color.
    `subject_sex` | Sex of subject.
    `lead_actor_actress` | The actor or actress who played the subject.

    Here is a sample from the dataset:

    title|site|country|year_release|box_office|director|number_of_subjects|subject|type_of_subject|race_known|subject_race|person_of_color|subject_sex|lead_actor_actress

    Before we proceed, it would be better for you to look at the data and develop some perspective about it.

    We'll look at multiple ways of slicing a `DataFrame`:
    * Slicing Columns by Label
    * Slicing Rows by Location
    * Slicing Rows by Label
    * Slicing Rows by Boolean Vector
