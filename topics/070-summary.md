    We looked at different ways to slice a `DataFrame`. Out  of these, the most commonly used methods are slicing columns by labels and slicing rows by boolean vector. Using these two methods, we can construct a SQL equivalent of `SELECT col1, col2, ... colN from table where col1=val1, col2=val2, ...`.

    The comprehensive documentation for slicing can be found on [Indexing and Selecting Data](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html) section in Pandas documents.
